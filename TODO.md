NAVBAR SECTION:  (MOST IMPORTANT:  PLS LOOK AT THIS VICKY)
1. IN MOBILE: the submenus of the menu should also automatically close when the mouse stops hovering over it. also I think the z index is too low for the submenus in mobile. when hovering over anywhere but the submenu (info and about submenus), the submenu should close
    
2. IN MOBILE When click on the any of the menu options/submenu options of â˜° button it should close after redirecting you to the correct link. Currently the menu stays open

4. IN MOBILE when clicking on the submenu options, it should change to the dark blue. make an {onClick function}

5. When no longer hovering over a submenu, it should close. Currently it stays open.

6. IN MOBILE the home and contact buttons should be formatted like the about and information buttons in the drop down. Right now, they are not centered and the border bottom does not right across the entire 150px

FOR VICKY: 
NOTES: to make dynamic : refer to my contact & class schedule page: 
either create a variable for whether the application is mbile or not by using window.innerwidth OR use vw and vh to edit the width and height of items (such as cards) to fit RELATIVE to the screen.
